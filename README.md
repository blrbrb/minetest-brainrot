**This mod contains loud sounds, flashy visuals, and jumpscares**. Furthermore, **this mod will break any immersion you have**. Brainrot is garunteed to give you internet psychosis. It adds several mobs that occasionally spawn around your world idly wandering into the distance making goofy sounds as well as a new and "improved" damage alert system that will trigger whenever your loose health. This mod is still under active development, and many more new features may or may not be added in the future.

**Disclaimer:** By installing this mod, you are doing so at your own risk. I am not an experienced developer. By choosing to install and run this mod now, or as future changes are made you may subject yourself to severe preformance downgrades and or temporary breaking issues as I learn to work with the minetest enviornment. Keep in mind that the purpose of this mod is mostly to amuse me and a few friends. And as such, may not receive regular attention.

**Bugs & Issues:** Feel free to leave issues, create forks, or even take the project for yourself!
